				<p>In a political career that began in 1985, Olivia Chow has been one of Toronto's most effective leaders – on the Board of Education, at Toronto City Hall, in Parliament, and on the national stage.</p>

				<p>Olivia was born in Hong Kong in 1957, grew up in Toronto, studied philosophy and art. She worked as a college professor, an ESL teacher, counselor for new immigrants and a sculptor. She won her first election in 1985 and served on the Toronto Board of Education for six years. Working with other school trustees, Olivia transformed a troubled school into the successful Rosedale Heights Secondary School. She also worked hard to elevate the academic performance of all students, no matter what background they were from.</p>

				<p>In 1991, Olivia was the first Asian woman elected as a Metro Toronto Councillor. She was re-elected five times, serving with distinction for 14 years before winning election to Parliament in 2006.</p>

				<p>While at City Hall, Olivia served as Chair of the Community Services Committee and Vice Chair of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), among other senior responsibilities.</p>

				<p>Olivia was central in forging nine consecutive balanced budgets as a member of the City’s budget committee from 1994 to 2003.</p>

				<p>Olivia gained national recognition for her innovative approaches to programs for children and youth as Toronto’s first Children and Youth Advocate. In this capacity, she enhanced the far-reaching child nutrition programs (now feeding over 150,000), free dental care for children living in poverty, expanded pre- and post-natal services, and an award winning approach to delivering Early Learning and Child Care (First Duty) that uses local schools as hubs for all child-centered services.</p>

				<p>Olivia also empowered and engaged youth by creating the Toronto Youth Cabinet, establishing after-school activities and anti-gang initiatives.</p>

				<p>First elected to Parliament as MP for the riding of Trinity-Spadina in 2006, Olivia has won re-election twice.</p>
				<p>In Parliament, during the time she served as the NDP’s advocate for children, her Early Learning and Child Care Bill laid the legislative foundation for a universal, high quality, affordable and non-profit national child care program. It received support from Parliament twice.</p>

				<p>Olivia was successful in working with the government in making a law to crack down on crooked immigration consultants. Her bill to ensure small businesses owners are not punished when they defend their property was borrowed by the government and became law.</p>

				<p>Olivia’s motions for Canada Portugal Day and justice for sex slaves during WWII received unanimous consent with support from all parties.</p>

				<p>During the years as an immigration spokesperson for the NDP, she has relentlessly pushed for faster family reunification and giving a chance for immigrants to succeed through recognition of foreign credentials and employment initiatives.</p>

				<p>Olivia was the Official Opposition Transport and Infrastructure Critic. Her bill on a National Public Transit Strategy was widely celebrated by mayors and municipalities from coast to coast to coast. Aside from her relentless work for a long term and predictable infrastructure funding plan, Olivia also laid out a roadmap for better rail and air safety.</p>
				<p>Olivia resigned as an MP in March, 2014 to run as a candidate for Mayor of Toronto.</p>

				<p>Throughout her career, Olivia has been at the forefront, working for progress for all residents. She has reached across party lines and travelled across the country, forging alliances with municipal and provincial leaders, business and advocacy groups.</p>

				<p>In 2014, Olivia’s best-selling memoir, My Journey, was published. </p>

				<p>Outside the political sphere, Olivia is known as a tireless spokesperson, fundraiser and champion of numerous charities such as Centre for Victims of Torture, Asian Community Aids Service and Culture Link.</p>

				<p>Olivia married Jack Layton in 1988, and together they forged one of Canada’s most remarkable political partnerships, sharing a passion for life and a commitment to change. Since Jack’s death in 2011, Olivia has continued the quest to make Toronto a better city and Canada a better country for all.</p>
